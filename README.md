This is a repository with a three-phase induction motor (controlled by triacs) soft-start source code for Microchip PIC16F54 microcontroller. This chip has only 25 bytes of RAM and 0.75 KB of FLASH memory. Phase control is used to work with triacs.

You can reuse this code, but please add a link to this repo.
